Boz explains that while those early startup days created great memories and camaraderie, they were forged through intense hardship - working 120 hours per week, gaining weight, having no social life, and constantly dealing with technical crises. He emphasizes that people only hear these romantic startup stories from the companies that succeeded, not from those who made similar sacrifices but didn't achieve success.",
