Jessica explains that while her three co-founders (Paul Graham, Robert Morris, and Trevor Blackwell) focused on technical aspects during 10-minute founder interviews, she concentrated on interpersonal dynamics and behavioral cues. She would observe whether co-founders worked well together, if founders were truly committed to their ideas, and whether they would actually quit their day jobs to pursue their startups full-time.",
